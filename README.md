# Alaska Tour Agency Website

The mock tour agency website is the first website that I've written in over a year. When I first began learning programming basics, I started by learning HTML/CSS. I learned this in order to make a blog website that never actually took off so I quickly moved on to learning Python. I only recently felt that I should brush up on HTML/CSS so that I could make a GitHub Pages website. The tour agency website is inspired by the fact that I currently live in Alaska and the tour industry is a big part of the Alaskan economy. This single-page website is very basic but is meant to practice the elements that I have been learning while going through the freeCodeCamp website.

Here are two screenshots of the Alaska Tour site:
