# Alaska Tour Agency Website

The mock tour agency website is the first website that I've written in over a year. When I first began learning programming basics, I started by learning HTML/CSS. I learned this in order to make a blog website that never actually took off so I quickly moved on to learning Python. I only recently felt that I should brush up on HTML/CSS so that I could make a GitHub Pages website. The tour agency website is inspired by the fact that I currently live in Alaska and the tour industry is a big part of the Alaskan economy. This single-page website is very basic but is meant to practice the elements that I have been learning while going through the freeCodeCamp website.

Here are two screenshots of the Alaska Tour site:

# Beck's Apartments Website

The apartment site is the next website I made after the mock tour website. I learned a few more tricks on freeCodeCamp (like flexbox positioning) that I was able to try out this time. This includes flexbox, links, and forms. This website, unlike the first one that I made, is inspired by an actual website. It is inspired by the [Weidner Apartments](https://weidner.securecafe.com/residentservices/apartmentsforrent/userlogin.aspx) resident login page. I tried to make a fairly similar website without looking at any source code. I didn't bother putting in every last detail or copying the words on the page so that I could put my own touch on the website. The ```Forgot password?``` link does not actually work and the form submission button doesn't actually work because I didn't build out the functionality. 

Below are some screenshots of the website. The first two are the top and bottom with the same window size. The third screenshot is a partial view of how the website does with resizing the windows:
